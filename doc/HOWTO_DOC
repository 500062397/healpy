The documentation uses Sphinx, some rst files and the doc included in the source code.

To create documentation :

- compile healpy and install it so that it is accessible from python
- go to the doc/ directory
- 'make html'

This will create the documentation in doc/.build/html.

The documentation is also on github, using gh pages (I followed the tutorial there : 
http://lucasbardella.com/report/hosting-your-sphinx-docs-in-github/).

All the documentation is thus accessible in :
http://healpy.github.com/healpy/

It is contained in a special branch of the project called gh-pages.

To modify this documentation, create a special directory :

mkdir healpydoc
cd healpydoc
git clone git@github.com:healpy/healpy.git html
cd html
git checkout gh-pages

Then, go to your healpy directory:

cd .../healpy
cd doc/
BUILDDIR=/path/to/healpydoc/ make html

It will override the files in healpydoc/html, which you can then check and commit.
